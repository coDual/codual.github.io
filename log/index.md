The log is an ongoing project to register (*log*) on a frequent basis things that I read, listen to, watch, play or otherwise enjoy. It is inspired by the Links from (the now defunct) [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) and [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net)'s newsletter.

Here you can read the full logs from the years in which I have recorded something:

- [<span class="year">2021</span>](2021)
- [<span class="year">2020</span>](2020)
- [<span class="year">2019</span>](2019)
- [<span class="year">2018</span>](2018)
