The last log edition on one of the most intense years of my life (so far!). This issue is dedicated to Montserrat Bellido Durán. Kinda problematic, but you spark joy!

## Videos

- Tom Scott released some more videos for the Language Files series. I particularly liked:
  - [Does the language you speak change how you think?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmZdGo6b5yA)
  - [Why don't subtitles match dubbing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU9sHwNKc2c)
- [Plagiarism and You(Tube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDp3cB5fHXQ)
- [GitHub Actions Feels Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qljpi5jiMQ). The pro-privative software stance is intensely annoying but you can mostly ignore it.
