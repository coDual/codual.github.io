### En español

### Videos

- [Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g). There are some minor inaccuracies re: how NFTs have been stolen but it's otherwise a very well put (albeit long and dense) video essay

### Books

- *House of Leaves*. I spent a lot of time reading this, and read less articles instead. I had never read anything from the genre, and it may be that there are better books of this kind, but this was a pretty cool read.

### Computer Science & Math

- [Version 100 in Chrome and Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/02/version-100-in-chrome-and-firefox/), because, of course, tons of websites did not foresee that you could have a three digit version in a browser, duh. It's interesting to compare this to curl's approach, which seems to be to [avoid version 7.100 at all costs](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/09/13/heading-towards-curl-eight/).
- [Contexts and capabilities in Rust](https://tmandry.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2021-12-21-context-capabilities). I don't love the feel of this, but it's a good stab at a problem not only present on Rust.
- [On finding the average of two unsigned integers without overflow](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220207-00/?p=106223). Did you know there was a patent on a one line function to calculate the average of two unsigned integers?
- [Retrospective and Technical Details on the recent Firefox Outage](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/02/retrospective-and-technical-details-on-the-recent-firefox-outage/). Woopsies.

- [Additional control characters for Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic texts](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21248-egyptian-controls.pdf), a fascinating Unicode proposal.

### Politics and society

- [Reality shifting: psychological features of an emergent online daydreaming culture](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-021-02439-3). You heard of [tulpamancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa#Tulpamancers), now prepare for "imagining Draco Malfoy is my boyfriend and believing it's actually true".
- [Voice confrontation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_confrontation), not a very interesting article but it's cool to know this has a name.
