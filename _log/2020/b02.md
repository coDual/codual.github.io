I thought this whole thing about a worldwide pandemic would have ended by now but I guess the whole world is stuck at home for at least a few weeks more, so here are some things that I liked reading or watching lately.

### En Español

- [¿Quién planchaba las enaguas de Jane Austen?](http://eugeniaandino.es/2020/04/20/quien-planchaba-las-enaguas-de-jane-austen/)
- La película _Vampiros en la Habana_, la banda sonora es increíble

### Projects

I am going to try to write here also things that are not very public-facing but still interesting, as a sort of diary. Some things I have done:

- Made some changes to [my webpage](mx-psi.github.io/)
- Learned some Go
- Learned some Rust, I am trying to rewrite an old project on Rust (maybe more about that on the next log?)
- Started at a new job (yay)
- Rewrote some parts of [the FilmAffinity to Letterboxd script](https://github.com/mx-psi/tidbits/tree/master/faLetterboxd) (thank you to the two people who made PRs :) )
- Started [using `hledger`](https://hledger.org/)

### Videos

- [This Video Has (Many) Views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0)
- [This is what our climate change denial looks like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTu4Xs23HXw) (CW: Climate change is very sad)
- [How We Reopen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhRQxk9QA-o) (after _The Plague_)
- [Why You Can't Name A File CON In Windows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC6tngl0PTI), on backwards compatibility
- [COVID-19 and Economic Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fnSVlLo05U)

### TV Shows, movies & documentaries

I have mostly watched films lately, here are the ones I liked the most in no particular order:

- _The Tale_ (CW: abuse)
- _Brokeback Mountain_ (CW: violent homophobia)
- _O Auto Da Compadecida_
- _But I am a Cheerleader_ (CW: homophobia)
- _Sorry to Bother You_ (CW: racism)
- _Mean Girls_
- _Creep_ (CW: it's scary)

### Books

I kind of switched to reading more books and less articles during the lockdown, both as a sort of experiment and because the whole world kind of only talked about COVID-19 and I wanted to read about something else.
The main conclusion is that reading fiction is a lot of fun, specially if it's in Spanish and I don't have to spend a lot of energy for doing it.

- _War with the Newts_ (no review, but I loved it)
- _Alternatives to Capitalism: Proposals for a Democratic Economy_ ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3278015903), freely available on the authors' webpages)
- _The Rust Programming Language_ (well-written; Rust is so comfortable to work with. I also solved [all the rustlings](https://github.com/mx-psi/rustlings-solutions))
- _The Signal and the Noise_ ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1731386493) I wanted to like it but I really didn't)
